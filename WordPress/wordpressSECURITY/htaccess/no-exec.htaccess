# Just to be clear this code should never be placed on webroot. this is specifically useful for sections like uploads folder where we only want static content to be present
# also it is to be ensured that if we have any specific extension in such folders that needs to be added in the list below. example php55
# this does inverse of allow_only_static as this basically assign all executable's to cgi-script and then disables CGI Execution in a way stopping execution of any file at server side.
